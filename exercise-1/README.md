## Learn Basics of Git

- Read through the code in `src/`
- Answer any `#Questions` as a comment
- Commit and push your changes to git
- Each commit should be responding to a single task or question
- Why is it important to keep your commit to a single task or question?
- Is it better to have a lot of very small commits, or one big commit when 
  everything is working?
- What are the most important commands to know in git?

## Introduction to Sockets

- Read the code in `src/tcp-echo-client.cc` and add a way to change the 
  message sent using command line arguments
- **Example**: `./client "hello message from the command prompt"` should send
  `"hello message from the command prompt"` to the server
- Commit your changes into git
- What do all these headers do?
- How do you find out which part of the below code comes from which header?
- How do you change the code so that you are sending messages to servers
  other than localhost?
- How do you change the code to send to a IPv6 address instead of IPv4?
- **Bonus**: How do you change the client code to connect by hostname instead
  of IP address?
  
## Introduction to Memory Management

- What is happening in line 26 of `tcp-echo-client.cc`? 
  `if (inet_pton(AF_INET, kServerAddress.c_str(), &address.sin_addr) <= 0) {`
- What is happening in line 31 of `tcp-echo-client.cc`?
  `if (connect(my_sock, (sockaddr *)&address, sizeof(address)) < 0) {`
- What is the difference between a pointer and a reference?
- When is it better to use a pointer?
- When is it better to use a reference?
