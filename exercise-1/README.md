## Learn Basics of g++ CLI

- Compile the TCP client and server using `g++` from command line.
- What are the most important command line arguments to learn for `g++`?
- What is the difference between debug vs release versions?
- What are the tradeoffs between debug and release versions?
- What arguments would you use in a debug build?
- What about for release?

  fundamentals with practical examples and common patterns.
- How else can you learn about make?
- How can you tell if the resource you are using is correct?
- Create a makefile such that when you run `make` with no arguments, it will:

  - Create executables **client** and **server** in `build/`, if needed
  - How does make know when it needs to rebuild the executables?
  - Change your Makefile such that `make clean` will remove `build/` and all
    its contents
- What are the most important command line arguments to learn for make?
- What are the most important directives to learn about in Makefile?
- What are the most important commands to implement in your Makefile?
- Which ones are essential, which ones are nice to haves?

## Learn Basics of Git

- Read through the code in `src/`
- Answer any `#Questions` as a comment
- Commit and push your changes to git
- Each commit should be responding to a single task or question
- Why is it important to keep your commit to a single task or question?
- Is it better to have a lot of very small commits, or one big commit when 
  everything is working?
- What are the most important commands to know in git?

## Introduction to Sockets

- Read the code in `src/tcp-echo-client.cc` and add a way to change the 
  message sent using command line arguments
- **Example**: `./client "hello message from the command prompt"` should send
  `"hello message from the command prompt"` to the server
- Commit your changes into git
- What do all these headers do?
- How do you find out which part of the below code comes from which header?
- How do you change the code so that you are sending messages to servers
  other than localhost?
- How do you change the code to send to a IPv6 address instead of IPv4?
- **Bonus**: How do you change the client code to connect by hostname instead
  of IP address?
  
## Introduction to Memory Management

- What is happening in line 26 of `tcp-echo-client.cc`? 
  `if (inet_pton(AF_INET, kServerAddress.c_str(), &address.sin_addr) <= 0) {`
- What is happening in line 31 of `tcp-echo-client.cc`?
  `if (connect(my_sock, (sockaddr *)&address, sizeof(address)) < 0) {`
- What is the difference between a pointer and a reference?
- When is it better to use a pointer?
- When is it better to use a reference?
- What is the difference between `std::string` and a C-style string?
- What type is a C-style string?
- What happens when you iterate a pointer?
- What are the most important safety tips to know when using pointers?

## Learn Basics of Creating a C++ Project in Your IDE

- How do you compile and run your project in your IDE?

## Improving Interactions with LLMs

- What is the most authoritative source of information about `socket()`
  from `<sys/socket.h>`?
- What is the most authoritative source of information about the TCP and IP
  protocols?
- What is the most authoritative source of information about the C++
  programming language?
- What information can you find about using Markdown when structuring prompts 
  to LLMs?
- What is the difference between LLM and AI?
- Is it grammatically correct in English to say "a LLM" or "an LLM"? Why?

**The debug mode is for developers while you are coding which helps in debugging it better. It does not automatically make the code faster by doing some optimisations. Release mode is used after whole code is done as it does optimisations which will make the code faster.**
